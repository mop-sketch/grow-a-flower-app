After a few days of that, the person slowly loses their sanity and they see spirals, patterns, and moving colors. Almost always it\'s so unbearable that the brain shuts down.</p>' +

At first the symptoms were average, but the brain doesn\'t shut down the 1st month nor the 2nd month until finally in the 3rd month they stand outside 24 hours and drink gallons of water before flowers slowly grow out of them and roots dig into the soil from them. It is unknown if they experience this while this phase is happening.</p>' +
